## Background
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Wildfire and spruce budworm (SBW) defoliation are the most widespread disturbances in the eastern boreal forest

- SBW affected over 9.6 mha of Eastern boreal forest in since 2006

- Boreal forests are adapted to both stand-replacing wildfire and SBW defoliation

- Independently, each disturbance facilitates the regeneration of boreal forest stands, however the impacts of their interactions remain uncertain

- The uncertain interactions between them are amplified by climate change

:::{.notes}
- lepidopteran defoliator
- they feed on current-year needles, partially or completely consuming them and, if large numbers of larvae are present, previous-year needles may also be affected
A single year of defoliation generally has little impact on the tree. However, it does cause weakening of the tree, making it more susceptible to attacks by other insects. Defoliation over a few consecutive years causes tree growth loss. However, if defoliation of current- and previous-year shoots continues uninterrupted over several years, some trees will die, while others will continue to gradually decline for several years, even after the end of the infestation. This is the case with fir, the species most vulnerable to spruce budworm attacks, which dies after four consecutive years of severe defoliation.

## Wildfire behavior and post-fire recovery

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

- Spatial legacies of outbreaks alter connectivity and amount of flammable fuels
- Altering wildfire behavior (e.g.,intensity) and their outcomes (e.g., burn severity)
- Intensity and severity directly influence post-fire recovery
- Shifts in severity due to legacies of outbreaks may lead to divergent post-fire recovery trajectories.

What is the fire behavior triangle?
Within a single fire, wildfire behavior can be explained by 3 factors: fuels weather and topography
- Topography alters wildfire behaviour by.
-Weather, such as relative humidity, wind speed and temperature
- Forest fuels are all the burnable materials in the forest, from underground to treetops. It is helpful to think of forest fuels in layers.
- a particular part of fuels is insect outbreaks 
- Insect defoliators change how fuel is organized in the boreal forest, leads to a lot more fien fuel buildup and contributes to ladder fuels, which connect the forest floor to the canopy and help promote high severity crown fires.



:::

## Current understanding of SBW x Wildfire behavior is unclear

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width="60%"}
- Spatial legacies of outbreaks have been shown to increase wildfire behavior (Fleming and Candau 2002; Jame et al. 2017)
- Various other studies report no effect
1. wildfires are noisy systems
2. wildfires burning in defoliated areas are a rare event
- We are trying to detect a small signal (specific change in fuel), in a large and noisy system.

![Fire Potential in SBW killed forests. Stocks, 1987](content/Stocks1987.png)
:::

::::

:::{.notes}
- Previous studies have demonstrated that legacies of SBW outbreaks increase wildfire behavior
- Others have found no effect
- This is a classic figure outlined by Stocks in 1987 which describes the fire potential in SBW killed forests. 
- it follows time since mortality on the x and the evolution of fuels following outbreaks
- it has been shown to increase, sometimes nothing and it is tough. (point to graph)
- Noisy system and rare event.
-- one potential reason for the lack of consistency in the findings is that wildfires are noisy, and we are trying to detect a small signal (specific change in fuel), in a large and noisy system.
-therefore our approach to look at how severity is affected I tried to minimize the amount of confounding factors


- we decided to approach this problem differently and try to reduce the uncertainty and remove noise 
`- Time since mortality and cumulative years defoliation are...`

:::

## Research Question

How do the spatial legacies of SBW outbreaks influence wildfire burn severity and forest recovery in the boreal forest?

- Is there a difference in forest recovery between 1-5 years and 6-10 years post-fire between defoliated and non-defoliated fires?

## Experimental Approach
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
*   matched pairs design
1. identified fires that had areas affected and not affected by SBW outbreaks
2. split fires in two - defoliated and non-defoliated
3. calculated burn severity using the Relativised Burn Ratio in Google Earth Engine (GEE)
4. calculated forest recovery in each area using a spectral measure of forest recovery (NBR)
5. Modeled the relationships between SBW legacies, burn severity and recovery using a piecewise structural equation model (pSEM)

::: {.notes}
We gathered remotely sensed burn severity and nbr data using Google Earth Engine (GEE). 
We initially gathered wildfire severity maps for each fire that burned in our study area based on the wildfire database for Ontario (77). 
Burn severity was measured using the relativized burn ratio (RBR), a Landsat-based fire severity metric that represents the change in forest cover following a fire relative to the amount of pre-fire vegetative cover rather than the absolute change. 
RBR maps were calculated using mean composited multispectral imagery from Landsat-TM, -ETM and -OLI, following the hybrid method developed for the boreal forest region by Holsinger, Parks (35) that uses MODIS imagery to determine start and end date of fires. 

**We decided to model these relationships using a SEM because we hypothesize that defoliation will indirectly influence forest recovery through changes in burn severity**

:::

## Hypothesized causal network

```{r dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent')}
DiagrammeR::grViz("content/chapter3-dag.gv")
```

::: {.notes}
**We used piecewise structural equation models too explore the causal pathways between defoliation, remotely-sensed burn severity and spectral measures of forest recovery. We fit our pSEM using linear mixed effects models controlling for fire id, province and fire year. this approach allows us to compare the strengths of the causal pathways between different network topologies and allow us to tease apart the relative contributions of a single driver when the mediation effects of others are taken into effect.**

**Defoliation here, is captured by time since disturbance and cumulative years of defoliation.**
**- time since defoliation is...**
**- cumulative years of defoliation is...**

**ISI is numeric rating of the expected rate of fire spread. It is based on wind speed and FFMC.** - higher ISI, more likelihood of canopy ignition and more severe fires
**BUI is a numeric rating of the total amount of fuel available for combustion. DMC and DC** 
- higher bui, more fuel to burn, higher severity


SEM allow us to examine causal relationships among variables, while simultaneously accounting for measurement error and condition effects based on other covariates.
One of the difficulties in modelling the effect of SBW is quantifying the severity of sbw defoliation.
Two key characteristics of SBW defoliation have been identified in the literature:
Time since defoliation and cumulative defoliation
Studies normally model these and individual predictors or in separate models.
It is possible that the lack of evidence for SBW-Fire interactions is due to models ability to capture defoliation severity.
I proposed a novel method to quantifying defoliation severity using latent composite variables in SEMs
Latent composite variables are used to represent a property (in this case defoliation severity) that arise from the collective influence of certain predictors. 
The error terms indicate that we do not include all the possible predictors because the condition of defoliation severity may also include unobservables.

:::{.notes}
Across both models 
- With every unit increase in ISI, we found an increase in BS by 
- With every one unit increase in the interaction between tsd x cyd, we see an increase in median severity
- However, as median severity increases, slope increases only in the first 5 years.

:::
## Takeaways

1. Median burn severity had a significant impact on recovery for the first 5 years following fire but not for the second 5 years. 
2. Mean temperature and total precipitation had a positive effect on the second half of recovery but a negative effect on the first. 
3. Defoliation indirectly effects slope of recovery for the first 5 years post fire through increases in median burn severity.


:::{.notes}

recovery is different from first five years to second five years

:::

## Next Steps

Test different measures of burn severity 

1. extreme severity 
2. variation in burn severity

```{r dev.args=list(bg="transparent")}
#|

  select(c(rbr_median, rbr_extreme)) |> 
  rename(`Median Severity` = rbr_median) |> 
  rename(`Extreme Severity` = rbr_extreme) |>
