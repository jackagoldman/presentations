## Background
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   Wildfire and SBW defoliationmost widespread disturbances in the eastern boreal forest
- SBW Affected over 9.6 mha of Eastern boreal forest in since 2006

-   Boreal forests are adapted to both stand-replacing wildfire and spruce budworm defoliation

-   independently, each disturbance facilitates the regeneration of boreal forest stands


-   However due to CC. the spatial legacies of defoliated areas are being increasingly burned, with consequences for wildfire behaviour and implications for wildfire recovery

## Previous studies

-   no definitive answers
-   window of opportunity
-   why?
-   big data problem?

## Our approach
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
-   quasi-experimental design (matched pairs)
-   why did we do this? control for noise

::: {.notes}
One of the difficulties in modelling the effect of SBW is quantifying the severity of sbw defoliation.
Two key characteristics of SBW defoliation have been identified in the literature:
Time since defoliation and cumulative defoliation
Studies normally model these and individual predictors or in separate models.
It is possible that the lack of evidence for SBW-Fire interactions is due to models ability to capture defoliation severity.
I proposed a novel method to quantifying defoliation severity using latent composite variables in SEMs
Latent composite variables are used to represent a property (in this case defoliation severity) that arise from the collective influence of certain predictors. 
The error terms indicate that we do not include all the possible predictors because the condition of defoliation severity may also include unobservables.

## Research Question

How do the spatial legacies of spruce budworm defoliation influence wildfire burn severity and forest recovery in the boreal forest?

1. How does SBW defoliation influence burn severity?
2. How does SBW defoliation influence post-fire recovery?
- Is there a difference in forest recovery between 1-5 years and 6-10 years post-fire between defoliated and non-defoliated fires?
